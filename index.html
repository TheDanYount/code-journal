                <h1>Harbor Festival</h1>
                <p>
                  Some text about a harbor festival. Maybe even some more text
                  about a harbor festival. Maybe it was an exciting day. Maybe
                  it was somewhat commonplace and adults saw it as either a day
                  to sell their wares or a day to spend a bit of their savings,
                  yet to children it would still be important. Maybe a young
                  child heard stories of festival wonders from the older kids
                  and longed for the day when he/she could experience it
                  firsthand, and that child finally went to the festival. I need
                  some more writing to test what happens when this entry is
                  longer so here it is, and here's some more, and some more, and
                  some more, and some more, and some more, and some more, and
                  some more, and some more, and some more, and some more, and
                  some more, and some more, and some more, and some more, and
                  some more, and some more, and some more, and some more, and
                  some more, and some more, and some more, and some more, and
                  some more, and some more, and some more.

                  Can you stop the differences between the two images? I
                  wouldn't try. They're actually the same image.
